# About

This folder contains two high-impact dashboards I built at the University of Houston. The first one, titled 'DWIF Rates and GPA by course characteristics', won the Best Presentation Award at the
Annual Texas Association for Institutional Research (TAIR) Conference. The second one is called 'DWIF Rates and GPA by student characteristics'. DWIF means unsatisfactory grades including D, Withdraw, Incomplete, and F grades. Both dashboards are being heavily used by senior leadership and relevant staff.

The first dashboard shows the relationship between DWIF rates and course characteristics such as instruction mode, course level, and core.
The second dashboard shows the relationship between DWFI rates and student characteristics such as gender, student classification, race/ethnicity, and full-time/part-time status.
