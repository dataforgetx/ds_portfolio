## About The Project

The Los Angeles County Probation Department (LACPD) utilizes the Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (LS/CMI) to measure the criminogenic (i.e., crime producing) risks and needs of probationers. While it is widely considered a valid risk assessment tool, Probation has not validated this tool for the probation populations in Los Angeles County since its implementation. In response to the state and county push of evidence-based practice (EBP), the various Probation operations wanted a validity assessment of LS/CMI and asked the Research Section to conduct a validity study of the tool in early 2020. Against that backup, this project assesses the predictive validity of LS/CMI through statistical analysis of the available data.

Due to the multilevel nesting structure, I opted to use [multilevel logistic regression models](https://commresearch.arizona.edu/classes/comm640/640_Book/docs/multilevel-logistic-regression.html#multilevel-logistic-regression-models) to find associations between the independent variables (LS/CMI and other covariates) and recidivism. Results showed that LS/CMI could moderately predict recidivism, but its predictive validity was moderated by gender and ethnicity such that there was a significant difference in LS/CMI’s predictive validity between black and white probationers. Further, probationers who received regular mental health treatments had significant lower risk scores and lower rates of recidivism independent of their level of corresponding criminal offense.

This finding was then shared with the Board of Supervisors (the governing body of Los Angeles County) and as a result a new policy was subsequently introduced to mandate regular mental health treatments including follow-up visits as part of the supervision condition for those who had a need for mental health treatment.
